# MonkeyModMangerRevamped


* Overhaul of MMM UI and pruning of broken mods
* to have your modded added, DM me the Github repository of the mod you want added along with any dependencies.
Mod submission is likely subject to change in the future.

### Ensure that
* your mod is built in the monke mod manager compatible format through `MakeRelease.ps1` (replace `netstandard2.0` with `netstandard2.1.0` in the code)
* you list the correct dependencies
* your mod is fully working
